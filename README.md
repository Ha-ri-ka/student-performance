harika dumb <br>
KARTHIK TOO <br>
LASTEST UPDATE: <br>
--->25/10 (harika) : encoded all non-numeric values to numeric ones and tried to find correlation between columns and G3 to drop columns with low correlation <br>
--->19/11(harika) : attempted multiple linear regression on data to predict value of G3, looks okay but dropping columns and graph needs reconsideration
