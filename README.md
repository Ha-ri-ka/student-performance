LASTEST UPDATE: <br>
--->25/10 (harika) : encoded all non-numeric values to numeric ones and tried to find correlation between columns and G3 to drop columns with low correlation <br>
--->19/11(harika) : attempted multiple linear regression on data to predict value of G3, looks okay but dropping columns and graph needs reconsideration <br>
--->20/11/22(harika) : performed polynomial regression and updated report with results of MLR, Poly, fututre work , acknowledgement and references.
